# Bank-Customer-Churn-Prediction
This project focuses on predicting customer churn and analyzing high-risk customers across different countries. By using advanced data analysis and machine learning techniques, I aimed to identify key factors that influence churn and create specific customer profiles for Germany, Spain, and France.


## 🚀 Project Objectives

- **Churn Prediction**: Predicting customers at high risk of leaving the bank using a machine learning model.
- **Customer Profiling**: Creating customer profiles based on demographics, financial data, and churn risk.
- **Country-Specific Insights**: Offering region-specific insights for Germany, Spain, and France to guide more localized decisions.

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies

- **Python**: Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn
- **Data Visualization**: Matplotlib, Seaborn
- **Google Colab**: For notebook execution
- **GitHub**: Version control and project sharing

## 📊 Key Features

- **Data Preprocessing**: Handling missing data, encoding, and scaling features.
- **Machine Learning Model**: Trained a classification model to predict churn probability.
- **Customer Segmentation**: Grouped customers into categories like age group, balance group, and salary group.
- **Country-Specific Profiles**: Created unique customer profiles for Germany, Spain, and France to identify regional patterns and behaviors.

## 🔍 Insights

- **High-Risk Customers**: Most high-risk customers are middle-aged with fair credit scores.
- **Balance Influence**: Customers with low balances are more likely to churn.
- **Country-Specific Patterns**: Differences in churn risk across Germany, Spain, and France, helping tailor retention strategies by country.
